"""Services package for workflow_runner.

Place business logic here. Keep functions small and easily testable.

This __init__ avoids eager imports. Importing individual service modules
should be done using explicit submodule imports (e.g. ``from . import run_service``)
to prevent import-time side effects and circular imports during refactors.
