## Overview

A suite of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) aimed at enhancing user experience with more interactive and visually engaging widgets.

Most UI elements used by the frontend belong to the [LF Widgets webcomponents library](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-widgets), a modern collection of modular and customizable webcomponents built on Stencil.js specifically to integrate with LF Nodes.

## What kind of nodes does it offer?

The nodes span quite a few categories:

- **Analytics nodes**: Visualize and track data, like checkpoint/LoRA usage or image histograms.
- **Configuration nodes**: Manage CivitAI metadata, and control the suite via the Control Panel.
- **Filter nodes**: Apply various filters to images, including blur, sharpen, and edge detection.
- **Image manipulation nodes**: Tools to manipulate images, such as filter and resize nodes.
- **IO Operations nodes**: Load and save files to/from the file system.
- **JSON nodes**: Tools to manipulate and display JSON data.
- **Latent manipulation nodes**: Latent decoding and encoding tools.
- **LLM nodes**: Interface with locally running LLMs, like the Messenger node, which also manages characters.
- **Logic nodes**: Control flow using simple switches.
- **Primitive nodes**: Work with primitive data types, offering features like history.
- **Region nodes**: Image region selection and editing tools.
- **Seed generation nodes**: Generate seeds for complex workflows.
- **Selector nodes**: Resource selection widgets with metadata display for models.

To see some example workflow you can check the [example_workflows folder](example_workflows).

## Installation

### ComfyUI Manager

- Open ComfyUI Manager.
- Search LF Nodes.
- Install the node suite and restart ComfyUI.

### Manual

#### Method 1: Download ZIP

- Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-nodes/releases).
- Download the latest release ZIP file.
- Extract the contents of the ZIP file into the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.
- Restart ComfyUI.

#### Method 2: Git Clone

- Go to the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder.
- Open a terminal.
- Copy and paste this command `git clone https://github.com/lucafoscili/lf-nodes.git`.

## Notes

The LLM nodes were tested with [Koboldcpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/tree/v1.73), but any Open AI-compatible endpoint that does not require authentication/an API key should work.
The model used in the workflows samples is [UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3](https://huggingface.co/UCLA-AGI/Llama-3-Instruct-8B-SPPO-Iter3) with [ChaoticNeutrals/LLaVA-Llama-3-8B-mmproj-Updated](https://huggingface.co/ChaoticNeutrals/LLaVA-Llama-3-8B-mmproj-Updated).
